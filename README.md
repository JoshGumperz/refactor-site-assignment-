# refactor-site-assignment-
The goal of this assignment is to refactor; or clean up the source code, without changing what it does. 

So the first thing I'm going to do is create copies of index.html and style.css so I can edit and modify the code, while still maintaining the original versions for reference. 

The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to replace the non-semantic tags in index.html with semantic ones where necessary.

After editing the index.html tags, I noticed there was an issue with some of the styling in the header, as style.css was referencing some <div> tags that I had replaced with <nav> tags. I went in to style.css and edited the code to match the changes I had made. 

The next thing I did was add alt descriptions to all of the images and graphics in index.html. 

After that I realized that one of the navigation links at the top didn't work. I fixed it by adding an <id> tag to the search-engine-optimization section.

Next I added clarifying comments to index.html and style.css.
