# Refactor Site Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to refactor & clean up the source code of the linked website, without changing what it does. 

## Getting Started

As you can see I've deployed a live site so you can see what the site looks like now. The changes I made were not visible to the user, meaning visually the site is exactly the same as it was when I got it. But taking a deeper look at the code, you'll see a number of key differences, such as:
- All non-semantic tags in index.html have been replaced with semantic ones
- All images have a descriptive alt attribute
- All Non functional links have been fixed
- Added a descriptive title
- Added descriptive comments to index.html and style.css for informational and organizational purposes
- Restructured style.css and eliminated some of the unnecessary repeating code
